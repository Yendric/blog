Toodl is a web application for tracking todos, and it also includes a planning view where you can create and print a weekly schedule. Toodl is also available as a PWA. I'm planning on rewriting it with a more robust offline mode and some more features.

The source code can be found on my Github: <https://github.com/Yendric/toodl-api>, <https://github.com/Yendric/toodl>
