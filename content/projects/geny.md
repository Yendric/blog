This blog is made using Geny. It's a very simple, very fast, and dare I say very elegant static site generator written in Go. I mainly wrote this because I wanted to learn Go and needed a blog (talk about killing two birds with one stone!).

Geny works using content made in markdown files and templates written in Go.
There's a built-in webserver allowing you to live-view your changes while you're adding content or editing templates.

The source code of Geny and this blog are available online: <https://github.com/Yendric/geny>, <https://github.com/Yendric/blog>. I even went through the efforts of writing documentation for Geny, so please check it out!
