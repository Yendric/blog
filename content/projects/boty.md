Boty is a simple Discord Bot with several basic features like moderation, memevoting and music playing. It's the first discord bot I ever wrote and also one of my first experiences with JavaScript (though I rewrote it several times).

The source code can be found on my Github: <https://github.com/Yendric/boty>
